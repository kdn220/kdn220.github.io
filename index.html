        Born in Media, PA ('Everyone's Hometown')... I came to earth to play the piano and learn. I used to read ferociously, then forgot how to by middle school, then picked it up again after college. I started Gleaners, a DIY education system, to introduce friends, make new ones and learn things with people.
